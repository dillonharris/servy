# Servy (Elixir Course)

## Learning from this course in Elixir
* #### Syntax
  * `:symbols` are called `:atoms`
  * `%{ "Object" => "Map" }` these are called Object maps

## Things I generally like about Elixir
* #### Concepts
  * Pattern Matching

## General things around Elixir and Erlang:
* #### Processess
  * Are lightweight and fast to spawn.
  * Run concurrently, and even in parallel if you have multiple CPU cores
  * Is isolated from other processes
  * Don't share anything with other processes
  * Have their own private mailbox, messages per process
  * Communicate with other processes only by sending and receiving messages
